# RyUkY_RefuelingNozzles

This repository contains a FiveM script that integrates LegacyFuel with ox_inventory for ESX Legacy 1.11.2. The script allows players to use jerry cans from their ox_inventory to refuel vehicles. Additionally, the script introduces a realistic nozzle interaction that requires players to use a nozzle from the gas station for refueling, further enhancing immersion.
